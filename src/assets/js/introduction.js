  "The city of Freeport is blockaded by the Dark Elven navy. Ogres and Trolls hammer at its gates. Goblins scurry up its walls. Fearing for their lives, its peoples cry out in despair. The wails echo into the night, suffocated by flames of hatred. Climbing through the sewers, you emerge behind the enemy ranks and make you way through the Commonlands, hoping to reach High Keep and deliver your plea for aid to the King. All of Freeport rests in your hands.";
